# EWS

The existing academic early warning platform can only provide corresponding early warning information according to the GPA points after a student has completed the courses in a semester. It cannot shorten the early warning period and advance the early warning time, which is not conductive to the timely adjustment of academic progress and study planning. So I want to do a more effective and efficient early warning system base on the students real time performance score.
The early warning system allows students to set their own goals for each course in advance and receive early warning information in time (if the real-time score is lower than the expected goal). Students can also view the scores of each courseâ€™s homework or exams more intuitively, and adjust their academic progress and study plans in time through early warning information. At the same time, the early warning system has also set up a tutoring booking system. Students can not only make appointments with tutors, but also solve academic problems through automatic responses.
The overall purpose is for students can track and analyze their own learning and adjust their study status in real time. At the same time, it also provides effective data analysis for educators to understand the overall situation of students and improve the quality of teaching.
